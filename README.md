Welcome to the Explorer application repository in the Fuel Developer Champions Program! ðŸ™Œ

This program seeks to empower Fuel developers and unlock your potential, to provide resources for you to level up your skills and to participate in the future development of Fuel. As a member of this program you will have access to dedicated opportunities to network, to learn, and to be mentored by leading devs in the Fuel community. You will also have the chance to showcase your work and to help others in the community. Let's not forget also access to exclusive merch based on your level and contributions!

If you are new to the Champions program, you can choose to either submit your initial application as an Explorer or as a Pioneer. If you have already joined as a Pioneer, you can apply to become an Explorer by submitting an application in this repository.

To begin your journey as a Fuel Developer Champion, simply [create a new application](https://github.com/fuel-champions/explorer-applications/issues/new/choose) in this repository.

The requirements to become an Explorer are:

* Experience in working on a Fuel project with links to the repository for the project and a live deployment if possible
* Evidence of community engagement and contributions to the Fuel ecosystem
* Agreement to abide by the [Fuel Developer Champions Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fuel-champions/code-of-conduct)

**Don't think you've met those requirements just yet? No worries!** You can still apply to join as a Pioneer by opening an application in the [Pioneers Application repository](https://github.com/fuel-champions/pioneer-applications/issues/new/choose). 

Once you have submitted your application, the Fuel team will review it and respond with next steps.
